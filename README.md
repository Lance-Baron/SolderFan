The goal of this project is to make my own solder fan, also sometimes called fume extractor. This started as I was shocked by the prices of filters, given that they are just a fan, and a filter. 

When doing research for this project, I also found the majority of them do not properly filter solder fumes out, as they use charcoal filters, not HEPA filters. I found that they do not filter out throught [this](https://www.sentryair.com/blog/industry-applications/soldering/comparing-solder-fume-extractors-its-all-about-the-filter/) link. Its a good read, and you can see I got many of my ideas from this article. 

To reduce prices, I just found a square [HEPA filter](https://www.amazon.com/20-81002-20-86883-Progressive-Whispertone-Panasonic/dp/B0CYC8G5DY?crid=1MQGWQIQ11IZC&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4gcygidnoWYwowDgM76I_6dEPpSY0pNmuf3U-HRlpikCQP7qKgyJa00I6fX-hxttsFYL4-WjccQ20lXNSj4le4LuC1uzqhpPaounSTwANOWIDogZ6hMskyQ2XYOTo5oT0aG2jGo-3XQMuEb5qD6-tR9PRKeBTWpV0p9wItiHcaLFqXzdxAC8cu05e2CbstwPfd5I9145K-VNvcRMY9A8y-PB3iCnbgNQVMwLTIlcJjc.NOBcHMs9oRzRtBVV2toZYs6sPzAZyemaNt5jwrRnrI4&dib_tag=se&keywords=hepa+filter&qid=1771705624&sprefix=hepa+fil%2Caps%2C259&sr=8-2) on Amazon, as well as some standard 12V [computer fans](https://www.amazon.com/Strong-120x120x25mm-Computer-Cooling-1600RPM/dp/B07D493BDX?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Fj1he09g2rYmTJk1keXhDAz0F9ZfC2FiD-CvyqoihXYhvo4hz7loQNC9NByMGLXPPuh_YLZb57zt8uVgY1q_57E-bY4g6VrGRKWQ4qmGfnp9p-HzLhNRJD6PlMVjIzGVUzEctj6X6e3wTnX0Ba1R1ahb3gQI_ICta_efkGT7buySdWxQTuOuBE8arY6ml29eVV3U8if8d8bK41HV8elJ-h6NsERoTy9oNpWc0BtKsyQ.J_YtjX3ok2GZddwHcR0QyvlmfVuZ6ghXbLYONCa1DEI&dib_tag=se&keywords=12v+computer+fan&qid=1771705651&sr=8-2). As they are already common parts the main body of the solder fan (at time of writitng) would be less than 10$.

Then in theory, I would just need to have some electronics to power the fan, and a case to hold it all together.
