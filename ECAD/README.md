For the electrical section, the goal is powering the fan. The max recommended power is 3W, and it operates at 12V

`3W = 12V * I`

`3W / 12V = I`

`I = 0.25A`

So there is not alot of power that needs to be trasfered here. For this amount of power, USB-C is overkill, but it is a common cable, so I will use it for this project. The problem is USB-C, without PD, comes in at 5V. Thus we need a boost converter here aswell.
